20 YEARS OF DATA
================
* "The 20 Years of Data Project is a project that looks at the last 20 years of my life, specifically looking at all the data that I have created and collected over that time period.
* I begin to look at datatypes in The Datatypes Project: Abstract Assembly.
* I then work on The Refcards Project within The Archives-Project.
* That takes me full-circle back to The History-Project, circa 2001.
