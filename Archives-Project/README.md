THE ARCHIVES-PROJECT
===================
* Professor Evelyn M. and Dr. Viktor Kropotkin get together to investigate the cascading failure that was The History-Project.
* Painter A., Alphonse Lemoyne, is writing his "How To Run A Financially Successful Art Operation", version 4.0.
* J.G. Dufray is working on The GameCode Project, as well as The Refcards Project, the latter with Alphonse.
* Soon they are to launch a related product design called the "Noxel Phone", after which Alphonse decides to pick up everything and leave the City for the suburban landscape he truly calls "Home", where he spent most of his youth.
* The previous two are also working on a project called "20 Years of Data", which comes after the Archives-Project in the triple:
  * THE HISTORY-PROJECT
  * THE ARCHIVES-PROJECT
  * THE DATATYPES PROJECT
* Beginning in the Summer of 2001 with the interdisciplinary art-based practise research programme known as "The History-Project", the artist known as A.G. has undertaken a series of other related "Art Projects" to eventually come to a full formalization of what is called the "Art Operations" workflow/workspace management methodology. After this point, it was realized that the entirety of his fictional output since the mid-1990s has really all been part of one grand "Magnum Opus" of novelistic fiction, whose unique TITLE and CONCEPT for the moment is being kept top-secret a.k.a. EYES ONLY. But as its unique independent author, I can tell you that it is great stuff.
